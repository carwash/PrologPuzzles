   Title: Finding the profession
Smith, Baker, Carpenter and Tailor have each a profession
(smith, baker, carpenter, tailor) but not showed by their names.
Each of them has a son.
But the sons also do not have the profession showed by their name.
If you know that:
1) no son has the same profession as his father has
and
2) Baker has the same profession as Carpenter's son has
and
3) Smith's son is a baker.
find the professions of the parents and sons.
